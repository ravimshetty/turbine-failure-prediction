# Turbine Failure Prediction

## Project Overview
This project predicts the likelihood of turbine failure using machine learning algorithms. The model is trained on historical turbine performance data and aims to identify key indicators for failure prediction.

## Folder Structure
- **data/**: Contains the dataset.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and exploration.
- **src/**: Source code for the project, including model, preprocessing, and utility functions.
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies.
- **app.py**: Flask app for deployment.
- **README.md**: Project description.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/turbine-failure-prediction.git cd turbine-failure-prediction

2. Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. To run the model, execute the following:
python app.py

2. For exploring the dataset and building the model, refer to the Jupyter notebooks in the `notebooks/` folder.
